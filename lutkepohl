# Notes on multivariate time series

L\"utkepohl, Helmut (2005), \emph{New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis}, Springer.

``In making choices between alternative courses of action, decision makers at all structural levels often need predictions of economic variables. If time series observations are available for a variable of interest and the data from the past contain information about the future development of a variable, it is plausible to use as forecast some function of the data collected in the past.''

This is a promising approach for socialists.  Like theorization in general, time series analysis is about informing one's practical actions.  For me, the ultimate goal is the transformation of society.  Understanding it and anticipating its evolution is crucial.
