# time_series

Learning time series analysis.  It's mainly notes for my own clairification in LaTeX and R code (R Sweave).  I guess my twist in learning time series is that I come from an experience in radical political struggles and, intellectually, a Marxian formation, though -- I hope -- not dogmatic.  I view things in terms of what is them for the immediate producers in motion to appropriate the product of their labor and the social relations they reproduce through their interaction with others.  So my learning will be filtered through my radical, socialist lense.
